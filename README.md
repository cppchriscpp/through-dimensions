## Art/Resources

All generated during the 48 hour compo, by me. Hence, they probably kinda stink.

Some characters generated with [2BitCharacterGenerator](https://0x72.itch.io/2bitcharactergenerator) By 0x72.

This thing is AWESOME for jams, seriously, check it out.

# Contributing

I don't have any set rules around contributions right now, and this is a quick-and-dirty Ludum Dare game.

Still, if there's something you'd like to do, feel free to submit a PR after the competition is over. 
Maybe you'll convince me to work on a DX version or something.
