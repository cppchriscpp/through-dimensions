# Through Dimensions

A Ludum Dare 48 Compo game. 

Through Dimensions is a new action/puzzle game for the Nintendo NES. (Yes, really!) 

One day, while tending to your garden, you notice an odd cloud, hovering near the ground. "What's this?" you ponder, unaware that this cloud might just change your life. 

Travel deeper and deeper (:wink:) through various dimensions in an attempt to get back home.

Don't forget to collect the gems as you go. Rumor has it you can buy your way back to reality!

This is _not_ a deep emotional game like my last Ludum Dare. After the way 2020 and 2021 went, I needed a real escape. A weekend of carefree game creation seemed like the perfect ticket. 

There's no underlying theme or anything- this is just a self-indulgent fun project. I had fun making this, and I hope you'll have as much fun playing!

## Art/Resources

All generated during the 48 hour compo, by me. Hence, they probably kinda stink.

Some characters generated with [2BitCharacterGenerator](https://0x72.itch.io/2bitcharactergenerator) By 0x72.

This thing is AWESOME for jams, seriously, check it out.

# Contributing

I don't have any set rules around contributions right now, and this is a quick-and-dirty Ludum Dare game.

Still, if there's something you'd like to do, feel free to submit a PR after the competition is over. 
Maybe you'll convince me to work on a DX version or something.
